TODOs

(content to be moved into an issue tracker once kotype has found a long-term home)


* Make work with nodejs 0.12.0 and later
some issue with bcrypt

* Kotype server dies with "Unhandled 'error' event" when the mongodb is temporarily unavailable
-> make kotype deal with that in a sane way

* support GIF avatars
gif avatars are not supported yet (upload eats everything though, and silently drops any non-jpg/png)
avatar pictures stored in cache folder.

Fixing those gifs was done using the mongo shell:
see: http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/query-documents/

mongo --port 31001 # to connect to db server
> use kotype
> db.users.find() to get a dump of all
> db.users.update( { "username" : "marcel" }, { $set: { "avatar_url" : "/cache/2092-1cs3n14.gif" } } )
> quit()

* support uploads of new documents via conversion server

* simple webodf util to create a new version from a given genesis file and a list of ops

* stop relying on external servers (like ATM done with closure library & CDN)

* add "Delete document" option, to avoid running over
